Luna is a voice activated chat bot that remotely accesses computer apps just through speech.

Our Problem Statement:

Using multiple files and tabs gets difficult to manage. it increases cognitive load and makes it difficult to work with.

The Proposed Solution:

Our project develops an AI-driven voice activated chat bot that can remotely access and interact with computer apps just through speech. It can also be customised as pe ruser preference.

How it works:

The project uses in-built pyhton modules and a few real time modules for information like time, weather etc. It takes audio input, detects the language, converts into text and runs the code.
